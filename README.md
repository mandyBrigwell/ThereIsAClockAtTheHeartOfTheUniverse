There is a Clock at the Heart of the Universe
================

A generative artwork by Mandy Brigwell. ‘*There is a Clock at the Heart of the Universe*’ is an exercise in restrained rotation. At its simplest, a line is extended and rotated around a point, varying graphical effects added along its length, for a fixed number of frames. The angle at which the line rotates is increased slightly over time, though the underlying rotation value ensures it completes at least one full rotation. Colours, stroke weight and translucency are affected by time and distance, producing radial effects like the spokes of a wheel.
